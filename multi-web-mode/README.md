## Introduction

Multi Web Mode is a minor mode which makes web editing in Emacs much
easier.

Basically it selects the appropriate major mode automatically when you
move the point and calculates the correct indentation of chunks
according to the indentation of the most relevant major mode.

Currently it is focused to work on buffers which contain html, css,
javascript and/or php, but adding other modes is really simple: you
just need to add your own mode to the `mweb-tags`. You can do that by
using M-x customize-group RET multi-web-mode and looking for the
`mweb-tags` variable.

All third packages were removed from the project repo (they were
included with mweb previously), mainly because it is difficult to
track new versions for everything and because it favored the user
laziness to check the basic configuration :).

The last multi-web-mode release which contained all packages was
0.2.1. It is still available from here:

## Why?

At the time I created multi-web-mode I had tried several of the
existing stuff that was available, but then I settled with MuMaMo
(from the nXhtml package) which I found pretty cool; although I was
having some problems with it, like: slow parsing, erroneus indentation
and hangs.

When I tried to look at its code to solve some of this stuff I found
it really difficult for me to follow. That convinced me to try to
write the simplest working version of a package that does multiple
major mode support, therefore multi-web-mode was born.

This was a long time ago, and I'm not sure how other packages
progressed but I think the key feature of multi-web-mode is the
simplicity with which detects the current chunk and indentation
(although the code it's not pretty, it was one of my first Emacs Lisp
packages and never got cleaned up properly :-). Another thing I
consider a feature is that multi-web-mode only focuses on 3 things:
detecting the chunk, activating the proper major mode and calculating
the indentation for it. It lets *unmodified* major and minor modes to
do its job without stepping in the middle.

## Requirements

You don't need any special libraries to run this package. Just the
ones you want to integrate to it.

Regarding the version of Emacs, this package was tested successfully
with >= 23.0.60.

## Installation

To install Multi Web Mode you'll need to do something like this in
your .emacs:

```emacs-lisp
(require 'multi-web-mode)
(setq mweb-default-major-mode 'html-mode)
(setq mweb-tags '((php-mode "<\\?php\\|<\\? \\|<\\?=" "\\?>")
                  (js-mode "<script +\\(type=\"text/javascript\"\\|language=\"javascript\"\\)[^>]*>" "</script>")
                  (css-mode "<style +type=\"text/css\"[^>]*>" "</style>")))
(setq mweb-filename-extensions '("php" "htm" "html" "ctp" "phtml" "php4" "php5"))
(multi-web-global-mode 1)
```

## Usage

Multi Web Mode binds the following keystrokes:

+ `M-<f11>` : Prompts the user to override the default major mode.
+ `M-<f12>` : Prompts the user to override the calculated extra
  indentation. Useful when the automatic calculation is not good
  enough.
