;;; Documentation:
;;
;; This minor mode provides some enhancements to ruby-mode in
;; the contexts of RSpec specifications.  Namely, it provides the
;; following capabilities:
;;
;;  * toggle back and forth between a spec and it's target (bound to
;;    `\C-c ,t`)
;;
;;  * verify the spec file associated with the current buffer (bound to `\C-c ,v`)
;;  
;;  * verify the spec defined in the current buffer if it is a spec
;;    file (bound to `\C-c ,v`)
;;
;;  * verify the example defined at the point of the current buffer (bound to `\C-c ,s`)
;;
;;  * re-run the last verification process (bound to `\C-c ,r`)
;;
;;  * toggle the pendingness of the example at the point (bound to
;;    `\C-c ,d`)
;;
;;  * disable the example at the point by making it pending
;;
;;  * reenable the disabled example at the point
;;
;;  * run "spec" rake task for project (bound to `\C-c ,a`)
;;
;; Dependencies
;; ------------
;;
;; This minor mode depends on `mode-compile`.  The expectations depend
;; `on el-expectataions.el`.
